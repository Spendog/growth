# Growth: The Efficiency Protocol

**Purpose**: This repository houses the "Growth Keys" and development templates derived from successful high-performance projects (e.g., the 1.1B Share ASIC Runner). It serves as a baseline for future development cycles, ensuring we start at the "Foundational Peak" rather than building from scratch.

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Foundational Peak**: The strongest gains come from the initial core architecture, not extraneous add-ons.
2.  **Hard Constraints**: UI and Logic must be bounded explicitly to prevent "drift" and overflow.
3.  **Context-First**: Development speed is proportional to the context provided in the initial ask.
4.  **Momentum**: In volatile systems, flow beats memory.

## Contents
*   **[GROWTH_KEYS.md](GROWTH_KEYS.md)**: The master playbook of principles that prevent error loops.
*   **[COMMUNICATION_STYLE.md](COMMUNICATION_STYLE.md)**: The blueprint for User-Agent interaction that yields the lowest "rejection rate".
*   **[PROJECT_INIT.md](PROJECT_INIT.md)**: A checklist for kicking off new projects with these principles baked in.

## Documentation (Synced from ASIC Runner)
*   **[VISION.md](docs/VISION.md)**: The long-term vision for Quantum-Inspired Computing.
*   **[ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)**: The technical path from Mining to General Purpose Search.

## Usage
When starting a new project:
1.  Clone this repo.
2.  Copy `PROJECT_INIT.md` to your new project's `docs/` folder.
3.  Follow the "Communication Style" when prompting the AI.
